### A minimal state machine implementation in Java

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tpvillard/fsm-basics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tpvillard/fsm-basics) [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/57f45d2383fc4ae791f496e146f022f9)](https://www.codacy.com/app/tpvillard/fsm-basics?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=tpvillard/fsm-basics&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/tpvillard/fsm-basics/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/tpvillard/fsm-basics)


This is inspired by the [scxml specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/).
There is already a lot of state machine [implementations](https://projects.spring.io/spring-statemachine/) out there.
This one is minimal (No compound states, No parallel states).

This implementation uses JDK 1.8 and is built with Maven 3.
